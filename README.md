Bughaw is a web-based technology that particularly aims to help Filipino students cope with those mental disorders, or what they termed as ‘Student Blues’. Bughaw is a school mental health digital management system, whose specific objectives are to:
- (G1) 🗣️ Respond to students’ mental health needs promptly through an optimized counseling appointment system, 
- (G2) 📊 Empower counselors to be more data-driven in guiding and intervening with students’ mental wellness, and
- (G3) 🪴 Foster available, accessible, and safe spaces for students to be equipped with adequate resources and support for their mental wellbeing to be nurtured.

We developed this app mainly by referring to the documentation of Streamlit, an open-source Python package for developing web apps (Snowflake Inc. 2024). For the Mental Health Feed, we used the publicly available code provided by Muralidhar (2023) for scraping articles from the RSS feeds of websites. Also, we referred to Alibudbud (2021) for two simple surveys that would holistically assess a student's mental health status. 🫂

Bughaw is deployed and is accessible at:
- Student Portal: https://bughaw-student.streamlit.app/ 🎒
- Counselor's Portal: https://bughaw-guidance.streamlit.app/ 🧑‍🏫
